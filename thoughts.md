#### My Thoughts

This was a pretty straight forward exercise in terms of using React and fetch. I definitely learned a lot from this challenge, such as how to handle events in React and getting more used to understanding React conceptually. I was more used to Node.js so I initially wanted to setup a process.env.SECRET_KEY but eventually came to the realization that one can't really store a key normally (at least given the time constraint I didn't think of another alternative). On the other hand, styled-components was definitely new to me. I have never encountered this library before and after going through the documentation, there's a lot more functionality then just plain old CSS. A majority of my time alotted in this approximately 3 hour span was figuring out styled-components and how to make things look prettier. In the end, I used styled-components to a minimum.
